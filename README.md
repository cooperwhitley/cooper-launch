# Cooper's Browser Launch Page

### Intro

It's what it says on the tin, just wanted something a little more visually pleasing and functional to greet me instead of Google. Sidebar, isn't it strange that the default start page for Chrome is still Google Search? I think everybody knows you can just use the address bar as a search bar now, feels like they could do something better with that. Anyways...
